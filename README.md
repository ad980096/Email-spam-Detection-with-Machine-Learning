# Email-spam-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates how to build an Email Spam Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
It processes raw email text, cleans it, removes stopwords and punctuation, and extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization.
A machine learning model is then trained to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Features:
Dataset loading and exploration
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal)
Feature extraction with TF-IDF
Model training & evaluation
Easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook implementation.
